# Setup
In the orginal setup, the server is run from a Raspberry Pi, while development takes place on a laptop. They have slightly different needs for their environment setup and so are addressed separately here.  

Overview:
* [Environment setup on Mac/Linux computer](#environment-setup-on-maclinux-computer)
* [Environment setup on Raspberry Pi](#environment-setup-on-raspberry-pi)
* [SQLite Database](#sqlite-database)
* [Raspberry Pi Pico W + Kitronik Air Quality Board](#raspberry-pi-pico-w--kitronik-air-quality-board)
* [Development Server](#development-server)
* [Deploying to Production](#deploying-to-production)


## Environment setup on Mac/Linux computer
### Pyenv
Use `pyenv` to change the python version for the project directory.* 
```
pyenv install 3.11.10
pyenv local 3.11
```
_\* Python 3.11 in this case to match the Raspberry Pi that will host the server for continuous data logging_

Ensure the following is in your `~/.zshrc`:
```
export PATH="/Users/username/.pyenv:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

### Poetry
To set up `poetry` environment:
```
poetry shell
poetry install
```

After this point, continue to [SQLite Database](#sqlite-database).

## Environment setup on Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi model 1B: Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

### Dependencies
`Pillow` requires `zlib` and `libjpeg`. Install with:
```
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

This project requires `numpy` to be installed with apt. See the section [Known issues with numpy](#known-issues-with-numpy) for more detail. 
```sh
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```

### Venv
`venv` is used instead of `poetry` on the Raspberry Pi. It is lighter weight and works well to lock down the version of `numpy` due to the problems listed below. 
A `requirements.txt` is generated with `poetry` from a Mac/Linux computer and then used by `venv` on the Raspberry Pi. See the [Development section](#to-update-the-environment) for more details on generating the `requirements.txt.`


`ssh` into the Raspberry Pi, and from the `weather-station` directory, run the following:
```sh
python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --prefer-binary -r requirements.txt 
```
*Note: `--prefer-binary` directs `pip` to use piwheels versions of packages if they are available. This saves time on compilation.* 

After this point, continue to [SQLite Database](#sqlite-database).


### Known issues with numpy
Some issues may be encountered with `numpy` throwing a `ChefInstallError` when running `poetry install` on a Raspberry Pi. 
If `numpy` appears to install correctly, it can be tested by opening Python and trying to import `numpy`. If it mentions the following error and fails to import then a system installation of `numpy` must be used: 
```
libf77blas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
``` 

The solution is to make `numpy` available globally rather than installing it with `pip` in the `venv`.  
```sh
pip3 uninstall numpy  # remove previously installed version
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```
See https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html#raspberry-pi



## SQLite Database
From the `src` directory, initialise the SQLite database with:
```
flask --app server init-db
```
The database will appear in the `instance` directory as `weather.sqlite`

## Raspberry Pi Pico W + Kitronik Air Quality Board
* Copy scripts from ```rp2``` onto Raspberry Pi Pico. 
* Change constants at the top of the copy of ```main.py``` on the Pico:
```
SERVER_URL = 'localhost'+'/data'
WIFI_NAME = 'Wifi_name'
WIFI_PASSWORD = 'Wifi_password'
```

From this point see [Development Server](#development-server) or [Deploying to Production](#deploying-to-production) as required. 

## Development Server
* To run the server go to the ```src``` directory and execute:
```
flask --app server run --debug --host=0.0.0.0
```
If running the development server from the Raspberry Pi, remove the `--debug` option


## Deploying to Production

### WSGI Server
Start [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) WSGI server from `src` directory using:
```sh
gunicorn -c server/gunicorn_config.py server:gunicorn_app
```

*http server to follow...*

Setup is now complete!



# Development

## To update the environment:
1. Update the `pyproject.toml` as required 
2. Run `poetry install` to install new packages 
3. Run `poetry lock` to update lock file 
4. From within the `weather-station` dir, generate a `requirements.txt`:
```sh
poetry export --without-hashes --format=requirements.txt > requirements.txt
``` 
5. Copy over to the Raspberry Pi (via `scp` or `git`) and install using:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --prefer-binary -r requirements.txt 
```

## Development of Pico scripts
* The ```rp2``` directory mirrors the scripts that will go onto the Raspberry Pi Pico.
