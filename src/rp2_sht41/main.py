Send temperature, humidity data from a SHT4x sensor to a server.

The server address, WiFi credentials, and update period are defined as constants
at the beginning of the script and should be changed as required.

After sending the data, the script will enter deep sleep mode for the specified
period, before waking up and running the main.py script again.
